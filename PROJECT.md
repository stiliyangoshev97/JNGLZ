## 🚨 CRITICAL: How Fees Work (READ THIS FIRST)

### Fee Structure - Total 1.8% Maximum

| Fee Type | Percentage | Recipient | When Charged |
|----------|------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Platform Fee** | 1.0% (100 bps) | Treasury (You) | Every buy AND sell |
| **Creator Fee** | 0.5% (50 bps) | Market Creator | Every buy AND sell |
| **Resolution Fee** | 0.3% (30 bps) | Treasury | On propose/dispute/vote |
| **TOTAL TRADING** | **1.5%** | - | On trades |
| **TOTAL MAX** | **1.8%** | - | With resolution |

### Example: $100 Trade
- Platform gets: $1.00
- Creator gets: $0.50  
- Goes to pool: $98.50

### Key Points:
1. **Platform fee (1%)** - Goes to YOUR treasury wallet. This is your revenue.
2. **Creator fee (0.5%)** - Goes to whoever created the market. Incentivizes market creation.
3. **Resolution fee (0.3%)** - Charged on propose/dispute/vote actions. Prevents spam.
4. **Both fees apply on BUY and SELL** - Double dipping for maximum revenue!
5. **Creator fee is configurable** - Via 3-of-3 MultiSig (0-2% range)
6. **Platform fee is adjustable** - Via 3-of-3 MultiSig (0-5% range)

## 💰 PUMP & DUMP ECONOMICS - How Early Buyers Profit

This is the **CORE MECHANIC** that makes the platform viral. Like Pump.fun, early buyers profit when others buy after them.

### The Math: Real Example with $1000 and $100 Buyers

**Scenario:** 
- Alice creates a market and buys YES with **$1000 worth of BNB** (≈1.67 BNB at $600/BNB)
- Bob sees the market and buys YES with **$100 worth of BNB** (≈0.167 BNB)
- Alice immediately sells all her shares

#### Step-by-Step Calculation:

**Initial State:**
```
Virtual YES: 100 shares
Virtual NO: 100 shares
Total: 200 shares
YES Price: 0.005 BNB (50%)
NO Price: 0.005 BNB (50%)
```

**Step 1: Alice Buys $1000 (1.67 BNB) of YES**
```
Amount after 1.5% fee: 1.67 × 0.985 = 1.645 BNB goes to pool
Shares received: 1.645 × 200 / (0.01 × 100) × 1e18 = 329e18 shares

New State:
- Virtual YES: 100 + 329 = 429 shares
- Virtual NO: 100 shares  
- Total: 529 shares
- Pool Balance: 1.645 BNB
- YES Price: 0.01 × 429/529 = 0.00811 BNB (81.1%)
- NO Price: 0.01 × 100/529 = 0.00189 BNB (18.9%)

Alice's position: 329 YES shares (cost: 1.67 BNB / $1000)
```

**Step 2: Bob Buys $100 (0.167 BNB) of YES**
```
Amount after 1.5% fee: 0.167 × 0.985 = 0.1645 BNB goes to pool
Current YES price: 0.00811 BNB
Shares received: 0.1645 × 529 / (0.01 × 429) × 1e18 ≈ 20.3e18 shares

New State:
- Virtual YES: 429 + 20.3 = 449.3 shares
- Virtual NO: 100 shares
- Total: 549.3 shares  
- Pool Balance: 1.645 + 0.1645 = 1.8095 BNB
- YES Price: 0.01 × 449.3/549.3 = 0.00818 BNB (81.8%)

Bob's position: 20.3 YES shares (cost: 0.167 BNB / $100)
```

**Step 3: Alice Sells ALL 329 Shares**
```
Using AVERAGE price formula:
- Price before sell: 0.00818 BNB
- Price after sell (simulated): 0.01 × 120/220 = 0.00545 BNB
- Average price: (0.00818 + 0.00545) / 2 = 0.00682 BNB

Gross BNB out: 329 × 0.00682 = 2.244 BNB
BUT pool only has 1.8095 BNB!

So Alice gets: ~1.78 BNB (limited by pool balance minus safety margin)
After 1.5% fee: 1.78 × 0.985 = 1.75 BNB

Alice's P&L:
- Spent: 1.67 BNB ($1000)
- Received: 1.75 BNB ($1050)
- PROFIT: +0.08 BNB (+$48 or +4.8%)
```

**What happens to Bob?**
```
After Alice sells:
- Pool Balance: ~0.03 BNB (almost empty!)
- Bob's 20.3 shares are now worth much less
- If Bob tries to sell, he gets very little back

Bob's P&L (if he sells now):
- Spent: 0.167 BNB ($100)
- Would receive: ~0.025 BNB ($15)
- LOSS: -0.142 BNB (-$85 or -85%)
```

### 📊 Summary Table: Who Wins, Who Loses

| Player | Invested | Sold For | Profit/Loss | % Change |
|--------|----------|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Alice (Early)** | $1,000 | $1,048 | **+$48** | **+4.8%** |
| **Bob (Late)** | $100 | $15 | **-$85** | **-85%** |
| **Platform** | - | $16.50 | **+$16.50** | - |
| **Creator (Alice)** | - | $8.25 | **+$8.25** | - |

### 🔑 Key Insights:

1. **Early buyers profit** when later buyers push the price up
2. **Late buyers lose** when early buyers dump on them
3. **The platform ALWAYS wins** - 1% of all volume
4. **Creators ALWAYS win** - 0.5% of all volume (even if they dump!)
5. **This is BY DESIGN** - It's what makes it viral like Pump.fun

### Why This Works (Game Theory):

1. **FOMO drives buys** - People see price going up, want to get in early
2. **Creators are incentivized** - They earn 0.5% AND can be first buyer
3. **Platform earns on volume** - Doesn't matter who wins/loses
4. **Volatility = Engagement** - Big swings create excitement

## Part 1: Project Overview

### 1. Project Purpose

**Prediction Pump** is a decentralized, permissionless "Fact Launchpad" built on the BNB Smart Chain. It is the evolution of the "Pump.fun" model, applied to real-world outcomes instead of memecoins. It allows anyone to launch a prediction market on any topic (social trends, sports, personal dares, or global news) with zero friction and instant liquidity.

### 2. Core Goals

- **Zero Barrier to Entry:** 0 BNB to create a market. Anyone can be a "market creator."
- **Frictionless Betting:** By using **Native BNB**, users bypass the "Approve/Permit" transactions required by USDT/USDC. It is a 1-click "sign and bet" experience.
- **Liquid-from-Launch:** Using **Bonding Curves** ensures that there is always a price for YES/NO from the first second, without needing external Liquidity Providers (LPs).
- **Sustainable Revenue:** **1.5% total fee** (1% platform + 0.5% creator) on all trading volume.
- **Pump.fun Mechanics:** Early buyers profit when later buyers enter. Creates viral FOMO loops.

### 3. User Journey

1. **Launch:** A creator enters a question, an expiry date, and an "Evidence Link" (e.g., a Twitter profile or news site).
2. **First Buy (Optional):** Creator can atomically buy shares in the same transaction - GUARANTEED first buyer, impossible to front-run.
3. **Trade:** Degens buy YES or NO shares using BNB. The bonding curve adjusts prices automatically.
4. **Pump & Dump:** Early buyers can sell at profit when price rises. Late buyers take the loss.
5. **Resolve:** After expiry, **Street Consensus** handles resolution - bettors vote on outcomes (30-90 min).
6. **Payout:** Winners claim the BNB vault proportionally.

---

## Part 2: The Bonding Curve (The Math)

### The Core Rule

```
P(YES) + P(NO) = 0.01 BNB (always!)
```

This is a **Constant Sum Linear Curve**. The two prices always add up to 0.01 BNB.

### Virtual Liquidity

Markets start with **100 virtual YES and 100 virtual NO shares** (scaled to 1e18). This:
- Sets initial price at exactly **0.005 BNB** for both sides (50/50)
- Provides instant liquidity without real capital
- Prevents division by zero

### Price Dynamics

| When This Happens | YES Price | NO Price | Interpretation |
|-------------------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| More YES bought | ↑ Goes up | ↓ Goes down | Market thinks YES more likely |
| More NO bought | ↓ Goes down | ↑ Goes up | Market thinks NO more likely |
| Equal buying | Stays same | Stays same | 50/50 odds |

### Formulas

**Price Calculation:**
```
virtualYes = yesSupply + 100e18
virtualNo = noSupply + 100e18
totalVirtual = virtualYes + virtualNo

P(YES) = 0.01 BNB × virtualYes / totalVirtual
P(NO) = 0.01 BNB × virtualNo / totalVirtual
```

**Buying Shares:**
```
shares = (bnbAmount × totalVirtual × 1e18) / (0.01 BNB × virtualSide)
```

**Selling Shares (AVERAGE PRICE - Critical!):**
```
P1 = price before sell
P2 = price after sell (simulated)
avgPrice = (P1 + P2) / 2
bnbOut = shares × avgPrice / 1e18
```

### Why Average Price for Selling?

This is **CRITICAL** for pool solvency:
- Buying uses instantaneous price → more shares when price is low
- If selling also used instantaneous (now HIGH) price → pool goes bankrupt
- Average price ensures: `bnbOut ≤ bnbIn` (approximately)
- Contract has `InsufficientPoolBalance` safety check as final backstop

---

## Part 3: Smart Contract Architecture

### Single Monolithic Contract

`PredictionMarket.sol` - One contract manages everything:
- Market creation & storage
- Trading (buy/sell YES/NO)
- **Street Consensus resolution** (propose → dispute → vote → finalize)
- Claims (winner payouts)
- Emergency refunds (24h timeout)
- Governance (3-of-3 MultiSig)

### Key Functions

| Function | Purpose | Payable? |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `createMarket()` | Create new market (FREE) | No |
| `createMarketAndBuy()` | Create + first buy atomically | Yes |
| `buyYes()` / `buyNo()` | Buy shares | Yes |
| `sellYes()` / `sellNo()` | Sell shares | No |
| `proposeOutcome()` | Propose result with bond | Yes |
| `dispute()` | Challenge proposal with 2× bond | Yes |
| `vote()` | Vote on disputed market | No |
| `finalizeMarket()` | Settle after voting ends | No |
| `claim()` | Withdraw winnings | No |
| `emergencyRefund()` | Refund if no proposal for 24h | No |

### Safety Mechanisms

1. **ReentrancyGuard** - Prevents reentrancy attacks
2. **CEI Pattern** - Checks-Effects-Interactions ordering
3. **InsufficientPoolBalance** - Prevents over-withdrawal
4. **Slippage Protection** - `minSharesOut` / `minBnbOut` parameters
5. **Pause Mechanism** - Emergency stop via MultiSig
6. **Double-vote Prevention** - Can't vote twice on same market
7. **Bond Validation** - Ensures correct bond amounts

---

## Part 4: Fee Distribution

### On Every Trade (Buy or Sell)

```
Total Fee = 1.5% of trade amount

Platform Fee = 1.0% → Treasury wallet (YOUR revenue)
Creator Fee = 0.5% → Market creator's wallet

Net to Pool = 98.5% of trade amount
```

### Revenue Projections

| Daily Volume | Platform Revenue (1%) | Creator Payouts (0.5%) |
|--------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| $10,000 | $100/day | $50/day |
| $100,000 | $1,000/day | $500/day |
| $1,000,000 | $10,000/day | $5,000/day |

### Why Creator Fee?

1. **Incentivizes market creation** - Creators earn passive income
2. **Quality markets** - Creators want volume, so they create interesting topics
3. **Viral loops** - Creators promote their own markets
4. **First-mover advantage** - Creators can be first buyer + earn fees

---

## Part 5: Resolution (Street Consensus)

### What is Street Consensus?

Street Consensus is a **decentralized resolution mechanism** where the bettors themselves decide the outcome. No external oracles. No waiting 48+ hours. Just the people with skin in the game voting on what happened.

### Why Street Consensus over UMA?

| Feature | UMA Oracle (Old) | Street Consensus (New) |
|---------|------------------|------------------------|
| Resolution Time | 48-72 hours | **30-90 minutes** |
| External Dependency | UMA Protocol | **None** |
| Who Decides | UMA token holders | **Actual bettors** |
| Bond Token | WBNB (wrapped) | **Native BNB** |
| Complexity | High | **Simple** |
| Proof Required | Yes | **Optional** |

### Bond Economics

| Pool Size | Proposer Bond | Disputer Bond (2×) |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| 1 BNB | 0.02 BNB (floor) | 0.04 BNB |
| 5 BNB | 0.05 BNB (1%) | 0.10 BNB |
| 50 BNB | 0.50 BNB (1%) | 1.00 BNB |

**Formula:** `bond = max(0.02 BNB, poolBalance × 1%)`

### Bond Distribution After Dispute

| Scenario | Proposer | Disputer | Voters |
|----------|----------|----------|--------|
| ✅ No dispute | Gets bond back | N/A | N/A |
| ✅ Proposer wins | Bond + 50% of disputer | Loses bond | 50% of disputer bond |
| ❌ Disputer wins | Loses bond | Bond + 50% of proposer | 50% of proposer bond |
| ⚖️ Tie (0 vs 0) | Gets bond back | Gets bond back | N/A |

### Timing Constants

| Phase | Duration | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Creator Priority | 10 min | Head start for market creator |
| Dispute Window | 30 min | Time to challenge proposal |
| Voting Window | 1 hour | Time for bettors to vote |
| Emergency Refund | 24 hours | After expiry with no proposal |
