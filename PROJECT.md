## 🎯 What is JNGLZ.FUN?

JNGLZ.FUN is a **decentralized prediction market launchpad** where:

- **Anyone can create** a prediction market (FREE)
- **Anyone can trade** YES/NO shares with BNB
- **Markets resolve** via Street Consensus (shareholders vote)
- **Winners claim** proportional share of the pool

Think "pump.fun but for predictions" - early believers profit when they're right.
