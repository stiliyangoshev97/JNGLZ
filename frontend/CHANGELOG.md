## [0.7.12] - 2026-01-14

- Shows `"Trading: — | Resolution: —"` breakdown placeholder
- Closed positions: Normal P/L display with green/red colors and actual breakdown

- **Problem**: REALIZED P/L tab was showing traders who re-entered the market (still hold shares)
- **Fix**: Only show traders who have FULLY EXITED the market (0 YES and 0 NO shares)
- Re-entering a market removes your entry from the REALIZED P/L leaderboard until you fully exit again

---

## [0.7.10] - 2026-01-13

### Fixed

#### Price Chart & Probability Calculations - CRITICAL FIX
- **ROOT CAUSE**: `calculateYesPercent()` was using hardcoded `VIRTUAL_LIQUIDITY = 100e18` instead of market's actual virtual liquidity
- Markets have different heat levels: CRACK=5e18, HIGH=20e18, PRO=50e18
- Using wrong virtual liquidity caused completely wrong percentage calculations (e.g., 83% instead of 54%)
- **Fix**: Updated `calculateYesPercent()` and `calculateNoPercent()` to accept optional `virtualLiquidity` parameter
- Updated all callers to pass market's actual `virtualLiquidity`:
  - `MarketDetailPage.tsx`
  - `MarketCard.tsx`
  - `PositionCard.tsx`
  - `PriceChart.tsx`
- Added `virtualLiquidity` to `POSITION_FRAGMENT` in GraphQL queries

### Changed

#### TradePanel Cleanup

  - ⚔️ If disputed & you win vote: Bond back + 50% disputer bond + reward = Net profit
  - ✗ If disputed & you lose vote: Lose entire bond = Net loss
- **Disputer Section** now shows 2 scenarios:
  - ✓ If you win the vote (1hr voting): Bond back + 50% proposer bond = Net profit
  - ✗ If you lose the vote: Lose entire bond = Net loss
- Clear explanation of which outcome disputer is voting for (opposite of proposed)

## [0.5.5] - 2026-01-10

### Changed

- Desktop layout unchanged (chart left, trade panel right)
- Used CSS grid ordering (`lg:order-1`, `lg:order-2`) for responsive reordering
- Heat Level Info moved to bottom on mobile (less critical, shouldn't block trading)

#### Heat Level Descriptions Updated
- **DEGEN FLASH**: Changed from "Perfect for viral trends that last 30 minutes" to "Maximum volatility — a few bucks swings the price 10%. For traders who thrive on chaos."
- **STREET FIGHT**: Changed from "One person pumps, the next person dumps" to "Classic tug-of-war battles. Momentum shifts fast, conviction gets rewarded. High ROI potential."
- **WHALE POND**: Unchanged (already good)

---

## [0.5.4] - 2026-01-10

### Added

#### Proposer Reward Display (Resolution UI)
- **"💰 EARN 0.5% REWARD" Info Box** in ResolutionPanel
  - Shows when user is about to propose an outcome
  - Displays estimated reward based on current pool balance
  - Dynamically calculates: `poolBalance × 0.5%`

- **Reward Confirmation Text**
  - Shows "✓ Bond returned + X BNB reward if correct" after proposing
  - Encourages users to propose correct outcomes

- **Finalize Section Enhancement**
  - Displays proposer reward info in Finalize section
  - Shows who proposed and estimated reward they'll receive

- **New Hook: `useProposerRewardBps()`**
  - Reads `proposerRewardBps` from contract (currently 50 = 0.5%)
  - Used to calculate estimated rewards in UI

#### Contract & Subgraph Updates
- **Contract Address Updated**: `0x986BF4058265a4c6A5d78ee4DF555198C8C3B7F7` (v3.3.0)

---

## [0.5.3] - 2026-01-09

### Added

#### Slippage Protection
- **Slippage Settings Component** (`SlippageSettings.tsx`)
  - Gear icon button in Trade Panel header
  - Preset buttons: 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 5%
  - Custom input field for any value (0-50%)
  - Warning message for slippage > 5%
  - Settings saved to localStorage and persist across sessions

- **Slippage Applied to All Trades**
  - Buy trades: `minSharesOut` calculated from preview with slippage applied
  - Sell trades: `minBnbOut` calculated from preview with slippage applied
  - **Default: 1%** - protects against price movements during tx confirmation

- **Trade Preview Shows Minimum Output**
  - Displays "Min. after slippage (X%)" with the protected minimum value
  - Users can see exactly what they're guaranteed to receive

#### New Exports
- `SlippageSettings` component
- `useSlippage` hook for accessing slippage settings
- `applySlippage(amount, bps)` utility function
- `getSavedSlippage()` for reading saved preference
- `DEFAULT_SLIPPAGE_BPS = 100` (1%)

### Why This Matters
Previously, the frontend was passing `minSharesOut = 0n` (no protection). This meant:
- If 10 users bought at the same time, later users could get significantly fewer shares
- Front-running bots could exploit this

Now with 1% default slippage:
- Transactions revert if price moves more than 1% unfavorably
- Users are protected from unexpected price impact
- Can adjust to higher values for volatile markets or lower for stable ones

---

## [0.5.2] - 2026-01-09

### Fixed
- **Max Sell Calculation**: Fixed `getMaxSellableShares` ABI - was missing `userShares` parameter

### Changed
- **Market Redirect Timing**: Increased to 5s for subgraph indexing
- **Market Detail Page**: Added retry mechanism (10 retries, 3s apart) for newly created markets

---

## [0.4.0] - 2026-01-08

### Fixed

#### Issue #6: Proposal failing with InsufficientBond
- **Root Cause**: Contract takes 0.3% fee from bond deposit, so net bond was below minimum
- **Solution**: Added 0.5% buffer to bond calculation: `bondAmount = baseBond * 1005n / 1000n`
- **File**: `ResolutionPanel.tsx`

#### Issue #7: Dispute failing with InsufficientBond
- **Root Cause 1**: Frontend ABI had wrong signature `dispute(marketId, proofLink)` but contract is `dispute(marketId)` 
- **Root Cause 2**: Dispute bond calculation wasn't using actual proposerBond from market
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed ABI in `contracts.ts` - removed proofLink parameter
  - Updated `useDispute` hook to only pass marketId
  - Removed proofLink input field from dispute section
  - Use `market.proposerBond * 2n` plus fee buffer for dispute bond
- **Files**: `contracts.ts`, `useContractWrites.ts`, `ResolutionPanel.tsx`

#### Issue #8: Voting UI unclear
- Users didn't understand what they were voting for
- **Improvements**:
  - Show Proposer outcome (YES/NO) and Disputer outcome (opposite) with color coding
  - Added prominent "🗳️ YOUR VOTE MATTERS!" banner with vote weight
  - Added "💰 No bond required! Only pay gas (~$0.01). Correct voters share jury fees." message
  - Changed button labels from "AGREE/DISAGREE" to "VOTE YES/VOTE NO"
- **File**: `ResolutionPanel.tsx`

### Changed

#### Issue #9: Markets page filters restructured
- **Before**: Only "Active" and "All" tabs
- **After**: "Active", "Expired", and "Resolved" tabs with counts
- Changed from `GET_ACTIVE_MARKETS` to `GET_MARKETS` to fetch all markets
- Client-side filtering with `useMemo` for better UX
- Each tab shows count badge (e.g., "ACTIVE (5)")
- **File**: `MarketsPage.tsx`

#### Issue #10: Portfolio page filters restructured  
- **Before**: Static non-functional filter buttons
- **After**: Dynamic filter categories with proper state management
- **Categories**:
  - `All` - All positions
  - `Active` - Positions in non-expired, non-resolved markets
  - `Needs Action` (⚡ animated) - Positions where user can vote on disputed markets
  - `Claimable` (💰) - Resolved markets where user has winning shares
- Filter tabs only appear when relevant (Needs Action hidden if count = 0)
- Proper empty states for each filter with helpful messages
- Fixed claimable value calculation: `0.01 BNB × winning shares`
- **File**: `PortfolioPage.tsx`

### Technical Notes
- Bond fee buffer: Contract takes 0.3%, we send 0.5% extra to be safe
- Dispute bond formula: `(proposerBond * 2n * 1005n) / 1000n`
- Position categorization considers: expiry, resolution status, dispute status, hasVoted flag
- Client-side filtering maintains server data freshness while providing instant filter switching

---

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-08

### Fixed
- **Pool Balance showing wrong value (e.g., "90000000000000000.00 BNB")**
  - Root cause: `poolBalance` from subgraph is `BigInt` in wei, but code treated it as already-converted BNB
  - Solution: Changed `parseFloat(market.poolBalance)` to `Number(BigInt(market.poolBalance)) / 1e18`
  - Fixed in: `MarketCard.tsx`, `MarketDetailPage.tsx`

- **Evidence Source and Resolution Rules not showing**
  - Root cause: Subgraph wasn't fetching these fields (fixed in subgraph v0.0.2)
  - Also updated UI to always show these sections (displays "Not provided" if empty)

- **Market images not visible**
  - Root cause: Same as above - subgraph now fetches `imageUrl` from contract
  - Images now display with grayscale filter effect on MarketCard, MarketDetailPage, and PositionCard

### Added
- **Grayscale image effect** on MarketDetailPage (matches MarketCard style)
- **Market images in Portfolio** - PositionCard now displays market images with same grayscale hover effect

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-08

### Added - Contract Integration (Phase 2 Complete)

#### Contract Read Hooks (`src/shared/hooks/useContractReads.ts`)

- `useClaim()` - Claim winnings after resolution
- `useEmergencyRefund()` - Get refund if market stuck 24h+

#### Feature: Create Market (Fully Wired)
- **Removed "initial liquidity"** - Contract uses virtual shares (100 YES + 100 NO)
- Working duration presets: 1H, 6H, 1D, 3D, 7D, 30D
- Optional "First Bet" toggle with side selection (YES/NO)
- BNB amount presets: 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1
- Shows FREE creation when marketCreationFee is 0
- Uses `createMarketAndBuy()` for atomic first bet
- Transaction success/error handling with BscScan links

#### Feature: Trade Panel (Fully Wired)
- Connected to `useBuyYes/No`, `useSellYes/No` hooks
- Live preview of estimated shares/BNB
- User position display with shares breakdown
- Buy presets: 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5 BNB
- Sell presets: 25%, 50%, 75%, MAX
- Loading states during wallet confirmation
- Success feedback with form reset

#### Feature: Resolution Panel (NEW - `ResolutionPanel.tsx`)
- Full Street Consensus resolution UI
- **Propose**: Outcome selection, proof URL, bond display
- **Dispute**: Counter-proof input, 2× bond requirement, time remaining
- **Vote**: Agree/Disagree buttons, vote weight display, voting progress
- **Finalize**: One-click settlement after voting ends
- **Claim**: Winning detection, claim button, success state
- **Emergency Refund**: Available after 24h timeout
- Time window displays for all phases
- Creator priority window detection (10 min head start)

### Changed
- `CreateMarketPage.tsx` - Completely rewritten to match contract mechanics
- `TradePanel.tsx` - Wired to actual contract calls with wagmi
- `TradeHistory.tsx` - Fixed field mappings (`isBuy`/`isYes` instead of `tradeType`)
- `PositionCard.tsx` - Fixed type interface, use `market.id` instead of `marketId`
- `PortfolioPage.tsx` - Fixed position type interface

### Fixed
- Schema export error (`ProposedOutcomeSchema` removed - didn't exist)
- NaN balance display in Header (added null check)
- Trade history trader address display
- Position card market ID linking

### Technical Notes
- All contract hooks use `useWriteContract` + `useWaitForTransactionReceipt`
- Read hooks use `useReadContract` with proper query enabling
- Position hook returns parsed tuple (6 values from contract)
- Preview hooks only query when amount > 0
- Form validation with Zod, proper error display

## [0.3.0] - 2026-01-08

### Added - Error Handling & Bug Fixes

#### Error Boundary (`src/shared/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`)
- Catches and displays runtime errors with brutalist UI
- **Chunk Load Errors** (after deployments): Shows "Update Available" with refresh button
- **General Errors**: Shows error message + stack trace (expandable) with retry/home options
- Integrated with React Router as `errorElement`
- Prevents blank screen crashes, provides actionable recovery

#### Price Calculation Fix (`src/shared/utils/format.ts`)
- **NEW**: `calculateYesPercent()` - Correct bonding curve formula with virtual liquidity
- **NEW**: `calculateNoPercent()` - Complement function
- Formula: `P(YES) = (yesShares + 100e18) / (yesShares + noShares + 200e18)`
- Matches contract's `_getYesPrice()` exactly with `VIRTUAL_LIQUIDITY = 100 * 1e18`

### Fixed

#### Critical Bug: Price Calculation Inverted (#2, #5)
- **Before**: `yesPercent = noShares / total` (WRONG - showed 0% after buying YES)
- **After**: `yesPercent = virtualYes / (virtualYes + virtualNo)` (matches contract)
- Fixed in: `MarketDetailPage.tsx`, `MarketCard.tsx`

#### Critical Bug: BigDecimal vs BigInt (#6, browser crash)
- Subgraph returns `totalVolume`, `poolBalance` as `BigDecimal` (e.g., "0.02")
- Subgraph returns `yesShares`, `noShares` as `BigInt` (e.g., "100000000000000000000")
- **Before**: Code tried `BigInt("0.02")` → crash
- **After**: Use `parseFloat()` for BigDecimal fields, `BigInt()` for BigInt fields
- Fixed in: `MarketsPage.tsx`, `MarketCard.tsx`, `MarketDetailPage.tsx`

#### Bug: Time Display Issues (#3, #4)
- Fixed `formatTimeRemaining()` being called with wrong parameter format
- Now correctly passes Unix timestamp (seconds), not duration (milliseconds)
- Fixed "ENDS EXPIRED" showing for non-expired markets

#### Bug: Image Not Displayed (#7)
- Added image rendering to `MarketDetailPage.tsx` in MarketInfo section
- MarketCard already had image support (was working if imageUrl provided)

#### Bug: Evidence Link Not Displayed (#8)
- Verified evidenceLink IS displayed in MarketInfo component
- Issue was likely empty `evidenceLink` from subgraph data

### Changed
- Reduced poll interval from 10s to 30s for trades ticker (prevents excessive refetching)
- Market detail page poll interval remains 15s for responsiveness
- Router now includes `errorElement={<ErrorBoundary />}` for global error catching

### Technical Notes
- Subgraph field types: `BigInt` = "123456..." (wei), `BigDecimal` = "0.02" (BNB)
- Always use `parseFloat()` for `totalVolume`, `bnbAmount`, `poolBalance`
- Always use `BigInt()` for `yesShares`, `noShares`, `shares`, timestamps
- Virtual liquidity constant must match contract: `100n * 10n ** 18n`
